# Bootstrap Lesson

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jakelever/bootstrap_lesson/main)

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks and a small data set for a lesson on the [Bootstrap method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)). You can launch this repo in a Jupyter notebook in the cloud using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jakelever/bootstrap_lesson/main).

To work along with the lesson, you should use the [Starter notebook](https://github.com/jakelever/bootstrap_lesson/blob/main/Starter.ipynb) which has the initial commands to load the data-set.

The complete lesson can be seen in the [Complete notebook](https://github.com/jakelever/bootstrap_lesson/blob/main/Complete.ipynb).
